# 🐾 Peddy - Pet Adoption Webpage

**Peddy** is a simple, responsive pet adoption webpage designed to test and demonstrate core frontend development concepts using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript (ES6)**, and **Tailwind CSS**. This project does not use any frameworks like React Router or backend integration — it's purely frontend-focused.
